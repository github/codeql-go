# Relocation notice: `github/codeql-go` moved into `github/codeql`

- Old location: The `github/codeql-go` repository
- New location: The `github/codeql` repository, specifically https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/go.
- Detailed announcement: https://github.com/github/codeql-go/issues/741

This repository previously contained the open-source CodeQL queries, libraries, and extractor for analyzing codebases written in the Go programming language with GitHub's CodeQL code analysis tools. These contents have been moved to the `github/codeql` repository, to live alongside similar libraries for all other programming languages supported by CodeQL.

CodeQL support of the Go programming language remains the same, except that the code and the development will continue in `github/codeql`.

Please visit https://github.com/github/codeql-go/issues/741 for more details about this relocation and how to update your CodeQL and code scanning workflows.
