Added support for user impersonation.
* [https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-1013](GOCBC-1013):
Added support for `StatsKeys` and `StatsChunks` to `SingleServerStats` to support responses for stats keys such as `connections` which contain complex objects per packet.

### Fixed Issues

* [https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-1016](GOCBC-1016):
Fixed issue where creating an agent with no bucket and a non-default port HTTP address could lead to a panic in `WaitForReady`.
(Note: `WaitForReady` will *never* return success in this scenario)

Fixed issue where bootstrapping against a non-kv node could never successfully fully connect.
