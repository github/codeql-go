  <overview>
    <p>
      When signing a JWT token, it is important to provide a secret key. If the secret key
      is an empty string, the JWT token can easily be forged by a third-party actor tricking
      the application to accept the JWT token as a valid token.
    </p>
  </overview>

  <recommendation>
    <p>
      Provide a secret that is not an empty string. Specifically,
      when calling the SignedString function for the jwt-go library verify that
      the secret passed to the function is not empty.
    </p>

  </recommendation>

  <example>
    <p>
      In the example below, the secret token passed to the SignedString function
      is an empty string. This leads to weak JWT encryption.

    <p>The corrected version passes a secret token that is not an empty string.</p>
